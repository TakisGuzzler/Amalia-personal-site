            <p>
                I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon. My primary major is Statistics and I have a concentration is Media Design.
                Last year I decided it would be a great idea to tack on a third area of study. Now I have an additional major in Decision Science!<br>
                I am currently enrolled in 36401, 67240, 88251, 88418, & 80210. <br>
                I also have a part time job on campus working at <a href="https://ideate.cmu.edu/">IDeATe</a>!

                Hello! I'm Amalia. I'm 20 years old and my pronouns are she/her.
                I created this website for my Mobile Web Design class (67240) but I hope to continue improving it as a personal project.<br>
                I'm from Princeton, NJ and currently have an apartment near my university.
                I would love to work in Pittsburgh because I've been having a wonderful time living here. My ideal work location for next summer is Pittsburgh,
                but I'm definitely open to going somewhere new.<br>
                During my time in college, I've gotten very involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay">cosplay</a>.
                It has been a wonderful creative outlet to contrast my STEM classes. Every cosplay that I make challenges me to learn new skills. It involves
                painting, sewing, costume patterning, prop making and much more! I am the president of
                <a href="https://tartanconnect.cmu.edu/cosplay/home/">Cosplay@CMU</a>,
                and lead the club on an annual trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsucon">Katsucon</a>.
